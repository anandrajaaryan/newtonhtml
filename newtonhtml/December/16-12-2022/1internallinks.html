        BMW The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides
        loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income countries
        for the purpose of pursuing capital projects.[5] The World Bank is the
        collective name for the International Bank for Reconstruction and
        Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA), two of
        five international organizations owned by the World Bank Group. It was
        established along with the International Monetary Fund at the 1944 Bretton
        Woods Conference. After a slow start, its first loan was to France in
        1947. In the 1970s, it focused on loans to developing world countries,
        shifting away from that mission in the 1980s. For the last 30 years, it
        has included NGOs and environmental groups in its loan portfolio. Its loan
        strategy is influenced by the Sustainable Development Goals as well as
        environmental and social safeguards. As of 2022, the World Bank is run by
        a president and 25 executive directors, as well as 29 various vice
        presidents. IBRD and IDA have 189 and 174 member countries, respectively.
        The U.S., Japan, China, Germany and the U.K. have the most voting power.
        The bank aims loans at developing countries to help reduce poverty. The
        bank is engaged in several global partnerships and initiatives, and takes
        a role in working toward addressing climate change. The World Bank
        operates a number of training wings and it works with the Clean Air
        Initiative and the UN Development Business. It works within the Open Data
        Initiative and hosts an Open Knowledge Repository.
